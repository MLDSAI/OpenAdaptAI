"""
The specified portion of the code uses PM4Py, a process mining library in Python, to demonstrate how to process an event log dataframe and discover a process model from it. Hereâ€™s why these particular methods are used:

    1. **`pm4py.format_dataframe`**: This method is used to convert a regular Pandas DataFrame into a log object that is compatible with the PM4Py library. The parameters `case_id`, `activity_key`, and `timestamp_key` are necessary to inform PM4Py about which columns in the DataFrame represent the case ID, the activity names, and the timestamps of the events, respectively. This step is crucial because PM4Py operates on these log objects to perform process mining tasks.

    2. **`pm4py.discover_petri_net_inductive`**: This method applies the Inductive Miner algorithm to discover a Petri net model from the log object created in the previous step. The Inductive Miner is a widely used process discovery algorithm that guarantees sound process models (i.e., models without deadlocks or livelocks and with proper completion behavior) directly from event logs. It is particularly favored for its balance between simplicity and fitness, making it effective for a broad range of real-world processes. The method returns a tuple containing the discovered Petri net, along with its initial and final markings. These markings are necessary for properly interpreting the Petri net, indicating the start and end points within the model.

    3. **`pm4py.view_petri_net`**: After discovering the Petri net model, this method is used to visualize it. Visualization is a critical step in process mining, as it allows analysts to inspect the discovered process model visually. It helps in understanding the process flow, identifying bottlenecks, compliance issues, variations, and improvement opportunities within the process. The method requires the Petri net, initial marking, and final marking as inputs to render the model correctly.

    The use of these methods demonstrates a typical process mining workflow with PM4Py: from preparing the event log, discovering a process model based on the log data, to visualizing the model for analysis. This workflow enables organizations to extract valuable insights from their event data, enhancing process understanding and supporting continuous improvement initiatives.
